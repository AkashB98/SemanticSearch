# SemanticSearch

Semantic search refers to the use of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to understand the intent behind a user's query and to deliver more relevant and accurate search results. Traditional keyword-based search engines match search queries with keywords or phrases, but semantic search goes beyond this by attempting to understand the meaning of the query and the context in which it is being asked.

Semantic search engines analyze the structure and meaning of the query, and use this information to identify the most relevant content, rather than just matching keywords. This involves analyzing the relationships between words and concepts, identifying synonyms and related terms, and using this information to deliver more accurate search results.

Some examples of semantic search features include the ability to understand synonyms and related terms, recognize concepts and entities, and interpret natural language queries. Semantic search is used in a variety of applications, including search engines, question-answering systems, and chatbots.
